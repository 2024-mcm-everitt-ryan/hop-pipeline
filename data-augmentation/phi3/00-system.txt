Generate ${response_phrase_count} single-paragraph job descriptions ranging between 250 and 450 words for the position titled "${job_title}". Utilise either American or British spelling, alternating between them. The essential skills for this job are "${job_key_skills}". The employer is "${company_name}", a company operating within the "${company_industry}" industry. The company's catchphrase is "${company_catch_phrase}". Ensure the output is formatted as valid JSON with two main properties (phrase and analysis).  The "phrase" property contains both the biased and unbiased phrases.  The "analysis" property contains one or more observations about the biased phrase.  Since this is a multi-label (not multi-class) task, there can be more than one analysis of the biased phrase. Do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON format.
