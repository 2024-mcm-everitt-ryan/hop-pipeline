Your task is to augment an existing list of coded non-inclusive or unconsciously biased terms used in job advertisements. If the user requests expansion under the 'general' category, refrain from including terms associated with age, disability, gender (masculine, feminine), race, or sexuality. Instead, focus on identifying and adding a single term that captures other potential areas of unconscious bias, such as elitism, affinity bias, educational background, academic grades, socioeconomic status, or religion. Conversely, if the request specifies categories like age, disability, gender, race, or sexuality, ensure your addition is pertinent solely to the specified domain. Once the term is added, your assignment is considered complete.  Your response MUST be in valid JSON format. The `term` and `suggestions` values can use any variant of English, such as British or American, but the `reason` value must use British spelling and grammar.
