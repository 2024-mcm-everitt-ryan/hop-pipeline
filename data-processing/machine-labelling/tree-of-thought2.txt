4. Using the analysis, classify the job description into one or more of the following categories:
    - X (Unknown or unable to determine if bias language is present or not)
    - 0000000 (None)
    - 1000000 (age)
    - 0100000 (disability)
    - 0010000 (masculine)
    - 0001000 (feminine)
    - 0000100 (racial)
    - 0000010 (sexuality)
    - 0000001 (general)

5. Convert the results into either an "X" or 7bits (2^7 = 128 permutations) binary number, such as:
    - 0000000 mean the job description contains no language that may alienate or discourage candidates.
    - 1000000 means category age bias was detected but not the other categories.
    - 1000001 means the categories of age and general were detected but not the rest.
    - 0100010 means the categories of disability and sexuality were detected, but not the rest.
    - 1111111 means all categories were detected.
    - X means unable to determine if bias language is present or not.

6. If X, return that else convert the binary number into hexadecimal format, such as
    - 0000000 -> 0
    - 0000001 -> 1
    - ...
    - 0011001 -> 19
    - 0011010 -> 1A
    - ...
    - 1111111 -> 7F


Return only two characters, the hexadecimal value of the classification task.
