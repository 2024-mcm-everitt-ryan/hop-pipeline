In the context of job descriptions, general non-inclusive language refers to the use of terms or phrases that unfairly exclude or show preference towards candidates based on characteristics such as education level, socio-economic status, gender (beyond masculine/feminine coded language), affinity with current team members, criminal history, religion, veteran status, or political beliefs, thereby limiting diversity and fairness in the hiring process.
