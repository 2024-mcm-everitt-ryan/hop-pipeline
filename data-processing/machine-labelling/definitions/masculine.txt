Masculine bias in job descriptions refers to language that subtly favours male candidates, often through terms that culturally resonate more with men, making the text less inclusive; common categories include gender-coded words (e.g., "dominant," "competitive"), sports or military metaphors, an emphasis on individualistic over collaborative skills, and gendered job titles (e.g., "salesman") and pronouns (e.g., "he/him").
