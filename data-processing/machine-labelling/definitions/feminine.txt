Feminine bias in job descriptions refers to language that subtly favours female candidates, often through terms that culturally resonate more with women, making the text less inclusive; common categories include gender-coded words (e.g., "nurturing," "supportive"), domestic or caregiving metaphors, an emphasis on collaborative over individualistic skills, and gendered job titles (e.g., "hostess") and pronouns (e.g., "she/her").
