Sexuality bias and non-inclusive language in a job description refer to the use of terms and phrases that exclude, stereotype, or show preference towards certain sexual orientations, gender identities, or expressions, making the job description non-inclusive by potentially alienating or discriminating against LGBTQ+ individuals; this can include categories like gendered language, heteronormative assumptions, and the lack of recognition for diverse family structures.
