Racial bias and non-inclusive language in a job description refer to terms or phrasing that unfairly favour certain racial groups or exclude others, which can manifest through stereotypes, cultural assumptions, or exclusionary language, ultimately discouraging diverse applicants and perpetuating inequality. This form of bias can include categories such as ethnic stereotypes, culturally specific jargon, and assumptions about linguistic proficiency or background.
